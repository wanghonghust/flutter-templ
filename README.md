[ ] Add preprocessing and training for Encoder/Synthesizer/Vocoder
Major upgrade on model backend based on ESPnet2(not yet started)
Quick Start
1. Install Requirements
1.1 General Setup
Follow the original repo to test if you got all environment ready.
**Python 3.7 or higher ** is needed to run the toolbox.
Install PyTorch.
If you get an ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch==1.9.0+cu102 (from versions: 0.1.2, 0.1.2.post1, 0.1.2.post2 ) This error is probably due to a low version of python, try using 3.9 and it will install successfully
Install ffmpeg.
Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the remaining necessary packages.
Install webrtcvad pip install webrtcvad-wheels(If you need)
1.2 Setup with a M1 Mac
The following steps are a workaround to directly use the original demo_toolbox.pywithout the changing of codes. Since the major issue comes with the PyQt5 packages used in demo_toolbox.py not compatible with M1 chips, were one to attempt on training models with the M1 chip, either that person can forgo demo_toolbox.py, or one can try the web.py in the project.
1.2.1 Install PyQt5, with ref here.
Create and open a Rosetta Terminal, with ref here.
Use system Python to create a virtual environment for the project/usr/bin/python3 -m venv /PathToMockingBird/venv
source /PathToMockingBird/venv/bin/activate

Upgrade pip and install PyQt5pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pyqt5

1.2.2 Install pyworld and ctc-segmentation
Both packages seem to be unique to this project and are not seen in the original Real-Time Voice Cloning project. When installing with pip install, both packages lack wheels so the program tries to directly compile from c code and could not find Python.h.
Install pyworld
brew install python Python.h can come with Python installed by brew
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Frameworks/Python.framework/Headers The filepath of brew-installed Python.h is unique to M1 MacOS and listed above. One needs to manually add the path to the environment variables.
pip install pyworld that should do.
Installctc-segmentationSame method does not apply to ctc-segmentation, and one needs to compile it from the source code on github.
git clone https://github.com/lumaku/ctc-segmentation.git
cd ctc-segmentation
source /PathToMockingBird/venv/bin/activate If the virtual environment hasn't been deployed, activate it.
cythonize -3 ctc_segmentation/ctc_segmentation_dyn.pyx
/usr/bin/arch -x86_64 python setup.py build Build with x86 architecture.
/usr/bin/arch -x86_64 python setup.py install --optimize=1 --skip-buildInstall with x86 architecture.
1.2.3 Other dependencies
/usr/bin/arch -x86_64 pip install torch torchvision torchaudio Pip installing PyTorch as an example, articulate that it's installed with x86 architecture
pip install ffmpeg  Install ffmpeg
pip install -r requirements.txt Install other requirements.
1.2.4 Run the Inference Time (with Toolbox)
To run the project on x86 architecture. ref.
vim /PathToMockingBird/venv/bin/pythonM1 Create an executable file pythonM1 to condition python interpreter at /PathToMockingBird/venv/bin.
Write in the following content:#!/usr/bin/env zsh
mydir=${0:a:h}
/usr/bin/arch -x86_64 $mydir/python "$@"

chmod +x pythonM1 Set the file as executable.
If using PyCharm IDE, configure project interpreter to pythonM1(steps here), if using command line python, run /PathToMockingBird/venv/bin/pythonM1 demo_toolbox.py
2. Prepare your models
Note that we are using the pretrained encoder/vocoder but not synthesizer, since the original model is incompatible with the Chinese symbols. It means the demo_cli is not working at this moment, so additional synthesizer models are required.
You can either train your models or use existing ones:
2.1 Train encoder with your dataset (Optional)
Preprocess with the audios and the mel spectrograms:
python encoder_preprocess.py <datasets_root> Allowing parameter --dataset {dataset} to support the datasets you want to preprocess. Only the train set of these datasets will be used. Possible names: librispeech_other, voxceleb1, voxceleb2. Use comma to sperate multiple datasets.
Train the encoder: python encoder_train.py my_run <datasets_root>/SV2TTS/encoder
For training, the encoder uses visdom. You can disable it with --no_visdom, but it's nice to have. Run "visdom" in a separate CLI/process to start your visdom server.
2.2 Train synthesizer with your dataset
Download dataset and unzip: make sure you can access all .wav in folder
Preprocess with the audios and the mel spectrograms:
python pre.py <datasets_root>
Allowing parameter --dataset {dataset} to support aidatatang_200zh, magicdata, aishell3, data_aishell, etc.If this parameter is not passed, the default dataset will be aidatatang_200zh.
Train the synthesizer:
python synthesizer_train.py mandarin <datasets_root>/SV2TTS/synthesizer
Go to next step when you see attention line show and loss meet your need in training folder synthesizer/saved_models/.
2.3 Use pretrained model of synthesizer
Thanks to the community, some models will be shared:

25k steps trained by multiple datasets, only works under version 0.0.1
200k steps with local accent of Taiwan, only works under version 0.0.1
only works under version 0.0.1
2.4 Train vocoder (Optional)
note: vocoder has little difference in effect, so you may not need to train a new one.
Preprocess the data:
python vocoder_preprocess.py <datasets_root> -m <synthesizer_model_path>
<datasets_root> replace with your dataset rootÔºå<synthesizer_model_path>replace with directory of your best trained models of sythensizer, e.g. sythensizer\saved_mode\xxx
Train the wavernn vocoder:
python vocoder_train.py mandarin <datasets_root>
Train the hifigan vocoder
python vocoder_train.py mandarin <datasets_root> hifigan
3. Launch
3.1 Using the web server
You can then try to run:python web.py and open it in browser, default as http://localhost:8080
3.2 Using the Toolbox
You can then try the toolbox:
python demo_toolbox.py -d <datasets_root>
3.3 Using the command line
You can then try the command:
python gen_voice.py <text_file.txt> your_wav_file.wav
you may need to install cn2an by "pip install cn2an" for better digital number result.

F Q&A
1.Where can I download the dataset?
Dataset
aidatatang_200zh
magicdata
aishell3
data_aishell
Original Source
OpenSLR
OpenSLR

After unzip aidatatang_200zh, you need to unzip all the files under aidatatang_200zh\corpus\train
2.What is<datasets_root>?
If the dataset path is D:\data\aidatatang_200zh,then <datasets_root> isD:\data
3.Not enough VRAM
Train the synthesizerÔºöadjust the batch_size in synthesizer/hparams.py
Train Vocoder-Preprocess the dataÔºöadjust the batch_size in synthesizer/hparams.py
Train Vocoder-Train the vocoderÔºöadjust the batch_size in vocoder/wavernn/hparams.py
4.If it happens RuntimeError: Error(s) in loading state_dict for Tacotron: size mismatch for encoder.embedding.weight: copying a param with shape torch.Size([70, 512]) from checkpoint, the shape in current model is torch.Size([75, 512]).
Please refer to issue #37
5. How to improve CPU and GPU occupancy rate?
Adjust the batch_size as appropriate to improve
6. What if it happens the page file is too small to complete the operation
Please refer to this video and change the virtual memory to 100G (102400), for example : When the file is placed in the D disk, the virtual memory of the D disk is changed.
7. When should I stop during training?
FYI, my attention came after 18k steps and loss became lower than 0.4 after 50k steps.
